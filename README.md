# Self-into
####  Hello there, I'm Suba🙋‍♀️ and i'm new to github😶‍🌫️ I'm a final-year college student from India majoring in Business Studies. Although my major is different, I have a deep interest in coding and designing. I've always had a passion for entering the field of Data analyst, and I'm currently working on improving my skills to meet the requirements for a role in Data Analytics and Science.💻📊



- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio and building a strong resume to prepare for upcoming interviews. Additionally, I'm adding new projects to showcase my skills and experience.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new skills such as computer programming (so far i have completed learning basic languages such as C,C++,Python and Mysql), Web designing, User interface and user experience design(Ui/Ux). 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on designing interactive websites and anything that is related.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help because I often get lost while learning coding since I don’t get to work with it on a daily basis. It would be really helpful to collaborate with other developers to gain experience and learn from real-time projects.

- 💬 Ask me about anything 👍
